# Agent notes

- Display official HKO/LD icons. Do not draw substitute warning symbols.
- HSWW level comes only from `iconIndex` (30 amber / 32 red / 34 black). Never infer level from HKHI CSV or from the title string.
- Do not commit `.env` or real site names.
- Rest numbers live in `config/rest_schedule.json` only. UI must not hardcode minutes.
- Instruction text lives in `config/display_actions.json`. Every displayed fragment must be a verbatim, contiguous part of a quoted official sentence; `tests/test_display_actions.py` enforces this. Never paraphrase official wording.
- Re-verify the official sources every April and whenever LD or HKO announce revisions (checklist: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-gate-screen-upgrade-design.md` §9).
- The screen's position only chooses the weather station. It must never influence warnings, rest times or wording, and must stay out of logs. Show humidity only with 香港天文台. Station coordinates live in `config/hko_stations.json` (`scripts/fetch_hko_stations.py`).
